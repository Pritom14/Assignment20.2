1. Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object is required. These include:

> Calling the instance method of a null object.
> Accessing or modifying the field of a null object.
> Taking the length of null as if it were an array.
> Accessing or modifying the slots of null as if it were an array.
> Throwing null as if it were a Throwable value.

2.  When we are starting AsyncTask inside a Thread , this error occurs.

3.  Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

4. Every activity should be declared inside manifest file, failing which causes an error.

5. The old method is deprecated starting in API 23, and the new method only exists in API 23+. You are attempting to call the new method on a device running API <23.

You can either perform an API level check and call the appropriate method, or you can use ContextCompat.getColor(Context, int) from the support-v4 library.
